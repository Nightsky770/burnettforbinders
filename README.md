The childrens' novels of Frances Hodgson Burnett for the DIY bookbinder. Available in letter and A4.

_**I have assumed throughout that you are using borderless printing**._ If your printer adds a border, you will need to make adjustments--the easiest way I've found is to increase BCOR by $borderwidth*2. For my own use (my own printer does not support borderless printing) I also set DIV to an artificially high 15, for smaller margins (since these will be enlarged in printing).
